This software is able to store, in useful detector data structures, Midas data unpacked with the Midas2ROOT software. The novelty of this software is that it can systematically map an arbitrary configuration of detectors (with DSSSDs, SSSSDs and Lamp Wedges) without any change in the code. All the information is uniquely given by a configuration file. The aim of this software is to be fully reliable for each experiment carried out with the Midas DAQ.
